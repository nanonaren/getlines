Program to fetch particular lines from a file.

REQUIREMENTS:

Need the parseargs package. To install this run
cabal install parseargs

USAGE:

./getlines "file to extract lines from" < "file with line numbers"

NOTE:
1) Line numbers can be separated by space, tab or newline.
2) Line numbers do not need to be sorted. They are sorted internally. If you don't want it to sort then add the --nosort option
